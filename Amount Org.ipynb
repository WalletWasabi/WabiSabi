    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "WabiSabi credentials allow participants to collaborate on a CoinJoin transaction. The server gathers inputs and outputs, and can ensure that output amounts are covered by input amounts without revealing anything about which inputs covered the costs of which outputs to the coordinator or the other participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the credential system supports arbitrary amounts, creating outputs with arbitrary amounts privately is not a simple undertaking. This is because the resulting transaction is still a Bitcoin transaction with transparent amounts, and these may reveal information about links between inputs and outputs, undoing the privacy benefit provided by the unlinkability property of the anonymous credentials used to construct the transaction."

    "## Value Proposition of CoinJoin Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally the utility of Bitcoin transactions to users is to be able to move value between users, i.e. send and receive payments. The utility of non-transfer transactions is limited to the extend that they support transfer transactions, since only the latter kind creates value by facilitating trade. Therefore when users participate in CoinJoin transactions spending to themselves, the utility of these transactions purchased with the mining fees is the improved privacy in the transactions that actually transfer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy in Bitcoin means being able to receive arbitrary amounts and obscure the flow of funds from the sender, and to be able to send arbitrary amounts with those funds, but without revealing their origin. This is difficult because the amounts and the transaction graph are transparent. Outputs of CoinJoin transactions can gain privacy when their containing transaction can be interpreted in multiple ways and it's not clear how to link inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In JoinMarket the taker pays both mining fees and maker fees in exchange for the knowledge that by choosing and coordinating between the makers, only they know the links between inputs and outputs (assuming the makers are not colluding or sybils). Since sybil attacks as a maker are profitable, fidelity bonds have been introduced, imposing a (time value) cost on makers, which gives stronger assurances to takers that if the makers are not distinct entities then the entity behind them must have sacrificed a significant amount of liquidity, thereby making such an attack expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the centralized setting every user pays only for their own inputs and outputs. As a result so the cost for each user is lower compared to taker fees, and the threat of spying by sybil attack by other users is lower compared to with makers without fidelity bonds as there is no profit. The mining fees paid by the other users and knowledge that the transaction was coordinated privately are ultimately what provides utility to the participants. Any coordination fees can of course be used by the coordinator to perform a sybil attack at a reduced cost just as with makers in JoinMarket, so those should not be taken into account as a deterrent, but the mining fees are an unforgeable cost imposed on a spying adversary whether it is colluding with the coordinator or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The centralized setting provides ample opportunity for positive sum outcomes. When constructed appropriately, larger transactions can provide better cost effectiveness with regards to privacy because total cost of a sybiled transaction must also include any surrounding transactions required to keep the attack plausibly deniable. This cost can quickly dwarves the fees paid by each individual user, which makes a targetted attack against them cost prohibitive. If an adversary attempts to reduce this cost by attacking multiple users at once the effectiveness of the attack rapidly decreases with the number of honest users.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also opportunity for users with different time or privacy preferences complement each other through mechanism design. In particular, users with higher privacy requirements with a low time preference can be incentivized to mix repeatedly with users that have a higher time preference and which would enjoy counterparties to the mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to improve the cost effectiveness of CoinJoin transactions is to use them directly for transfers, instead of only self spends. This requires privacy for arbitrary amounts. By spending from a CoinJoin transaction directly to a recipient's address, if the payment amount is sufficiently ambiguous within the transaction privacy can be preserved with a smaller blockspace requirement. JoinMarket supports this for both takers and makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better yet is the cooperative case where a sender and receiver both participating in the same CoinJoin transaction, each with their own (private) input amounts. Using credentials users can transfer value in a CoinJoin transaction while maintaining privacy from each other and the rest of the world, while also calling into question the validity of various heuristics used to analyze CoinJoin transactions by amount, in a similar way that PayJoin do."

    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above value proposition, the coordinator's job is help users to pay mining fees together in a way that only the individual users know how to map their own inputs and outputs, and the transaction as a whole is ambiguous. The degree of ambiguity can vary, but ideally for every output amount there will be at least some ambiguity, that is more than one way of explaining how the output was funded by some combination of input amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this study is to attempt to find a strategy for participation in CoinJoins based on WabiSabi credentials thereby that is compatible with the value proposition laid out above. By focusing on the potential for positive sum outcomes through incentive compatibility the hope is to find a Pareto efficient approach to constructing CoinJoins that is convincing enough to establish something resembling a Schelling point.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many questions to address and the design space is huge. Because protocol upgrades are hard and software needs incremental improvements, it would be best to keep the protocol as simple as possible and do as much as possible on the client side. To ensure positive sum outcomes and avoid fingerprinting some behaviours need to be consistent for all clients, damaging privacy when changed in upgrades, especially if users upgrade slowly. Finally, some tweaks and improvements as well as runtime parameters can vary between users based on their threat model and individual utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "To approach the questions about what client behaviour should in a logical order we aim to answer them in the following order, more or less:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. behaviours must be the same for all users, requiring major releases which may break compatibility to improve,\n",
    "2. behaviours that should be the same for all users, can be improved iteratively after release\n",
    "3. behaviours which can be parameterized by individual user preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "Care must still be taken to ensure that allowing client diversity or leaving some alternatives unexplored should not result in loss of privacy, so some aspects of user parameterizable behaviour might need to be addressed before the release, but for the most part questions like which optimizer strategy is best for minimizing cost are ones where incremental improvements on the answers can be obtained afterwards."

    "## Working Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Tcoordinator imposes no special constraints on input and output registrations. However, additional constraints may be added later if necessary or desirable without much complication, for example minimum input requirements on some transactions would allow users with larger amounts to find each other more easily, and the coordinator can also constrain the registered amounts (inputs as well as outputs) in order to provide stronger assurances for the ambiguity. In the simplest scenario any outcome that can be achieved by making a transaction on your own should possible as part of a CoinJoin transaction in principle, and unless a good reason arises we should not rely on removal of this flexibility at the protocol level.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists some arbitrary set of standard denominations is known by all users. This set should be sparse in the range of the amounts that can be used. Equal amount outputs whose values are drawn from this set form the foundation for privacy with which we aim to support arbitrary amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of [non-derived sub-transactions](](https://sci-hub.se/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8029483)) is a limiting constraint on the anonymity set size of any output (standard or arbitrary amount), and threrefore the privacy provided by the transaction. Another constraint is the (unobservable) number of other participants and the anonymity set sizes of their inputs, which in turn is bounded by `min(len(inputs), len(outputs))`. Although the latter is not under the user's control, the choice of output amounts does affect the former.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the actions of individual users agree the privacy of all users' outputs improves on average because the average number of non-derived sub-transactions per output can grow exponentially (albeit with [diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebig%27s_law_of_the_minimum), since it's only one of several relevant lower bounds). Conversely, since with every de-anonymized user the overall privacy can also diminish exponentially, so a healthy safety margin is in order for this limiting constraint. Exponential growth is more likely when trivial equivalence relations between non-derived sub-transactions are given by equal amount outputs, so the actions of individual users \"agreeing\" means there are sufficiently many equal amount outputs and that the amounts are related in such a way that their combinatorics creates a large degree of ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work the server must announce the (possibly monotonically growing) set of the input (and optionally output) registrations. In the simplest case the coordinator must broadcast ownership proofs from the registered inputs to all participants before output registration starts. This is necessary to ensure that the credentials were all issued with the same parameters, a requirement for unlinkability. For full nodes this is sufficient information to verify input amounts and spend status. With Merkle inclusion proofs light clients can verify the former but not the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "With knowledge of the other users amounts, and the knowledge that other users also know this, participants can improve the likelyhood of (or with dynamic updated information about about output registrations, guaranteee) a sufficiently high lower bound on the number of sub-transactions for the outputs they choose to register. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, keeping this restricted set mostly consistent between transactions provides: when users mix repeatedly especially over longer periods time period, in the best case the ambiguity per output can compound by [inheritance](https://medium.com/samourai-wallet/diving-head-first-into-whirlpool-anonymity-sets-4156a54b0bc7) logistically instead of linearly in the number of transactions of the user, since the inherited ambiguity is potentially bounded by the width of the mixing graph as a whole in those circumstances and not only the counterparties to each individual transaction."

    "Because amounts in CoinJoin transactions can reveal information about links between inputs and outputs, we want to look at the representations of numerical values from the range of possible input balances users may have in as sums of values from a small subset of the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Positional notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation) is a logical starting point for choosing such subsets because the size of the set of values used is logarithmic in the range of the possible input values that can be represented using their members. We can use the [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight) of satoshi amounts in various bases as a benchmark to compare against.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based therefore given an  we can quantify the number of outputs that would be required to decompose an arbitrary input balance (the sum of the inputs minus the any fees taken into account).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the cost per output is 0 and no dust threshold is used, the following functions all return the Hamming weight (just more slowly). When but when non-zero values are used the resulting weights deviate, and instead of returning the Hamming weight per se they give the estimated number of minimal Hamming weight transaction outputs required to decompose the given amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by subtracting the cost per output remaining amount after each successive digit. An alternative approach would be - assuming decimal values as an example and a cost of `100` satoshis per output -- decompose e.g. `0.00012000` into `0.00009900` and `0.00000900` (`0.00010000 - 100` and `0.00001000 - 100`), but these functions simulate decomposition of the amount `0.00012000` into `0.00010000`, and then decompose the remaining `1900` sats into `0.00001000`, leaving 800 sats, etc, in an iterative approach. Note that this is symmetric (either the input side or the output side of a transaction must account for the fees), so the choice appears arbitrary (TODO verify this claim)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dust threshold determines when the decomposition stops - with a nonzero value the least significant digits may be dropped, resulting in a lower final weight. The cost per output determines the overhead of the decomposition, resulting in hamming weight transitions shifting."

Reducing the density of the denomination set trades off block space for privacy, requiring more outputs overall and increasing the likelyhood that equal amounts will be used.\n",

    "This plot is kind of annoying to use because it's slow to update with higher iteration counts, but higher iteration counts are where the interactivity is interesting for exploring the parameter space. It definitely needs more work but is still kind of useful for exploring weights of samples or sequences of values values.\n",

With a dust threshold of 0 and and fees of 0 on powers of two this is the identical to its popcount/Hamming weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "When plotting a sequence, moving the start point around and changing the step size can show different values. As the step size increases certain values get skipped (do not be misled by the minimum being a line, as it is subsampled, and should really be the a minimum over a window around the step range proportional to the dust threshold, not just the shown value, but that's complicated).\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the dust threshold will lower all weights by neglecting the least significant digits. If this is smaller than the step size, the plotted data will be undersampled.\n",

    "Increasing the feerate imposes an implicit dust threshold (minimum cost of an input), shifts boundaries/jumps in the weights to the right, and can either reduce or increase the weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy algorithm can perform pathologically, e.g. when a a value is a small weight in two adjacent denominations (e.g. 525 sats woul get decomposed as 512 sats + 8 sats + 4 sats + 1 sat for a weight of 4 instead of pure 1-2-5 which would need only 500, 20 and 5 for a weight of 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the number of iterations for the stochastic algorithms will bring the distribution of stochastic weights down since only the minimum weight value generated is plotted. This should generally matching or do better the performance of the minimum value from the deterministic algorithms with enough iterations (1e2 is mostly fine, with some noise occasionally, 1e3 is pretty reliable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the `drop_fraction` will randomly drop certain values, but take this parameter with a grain of salt as a uniform probability doesn't really make sense, it just highlights the difficulty of decomposing arbitrary amounts given a restricted set of values when that set is too sparse or does not agree with the amounts slated for decomposition. Ticking `drop_from_homogonous` substitutes the binary, ternary and 1-2-5 weight computations with greedy decomposition restricted to that base, which makes it a little easier to see which bases were damaged the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially the plot uses the default values of `plot_decompositions`, which specify to plot 50 numerical values on the x axis, starting from 0.1 BTC (1e7), with steps of size 1 (1e0), with 1 sat/vbyte in fees (assumed to cost 31 sat/output) and a dust threshold of 0, and only 1 iteration of the stochastic decomposition (1e0). This will show the transition from high hamming weights (because only values greater or equal to 0.10000031 will be able produce a single 0.1 output at 1 sat/vbyte). This corresponds to the drop of the green dots (1-2-5 series weights). You can see similar transitoins "

    "\n",
    "The input amounts are known to all clients but the combined input clusters, which determine the balance that a user will split, are only known to their owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can try guess which denominations are most likely to be used as outputs in a transaction, base on just the individual amounts. If they are confident in their guess, then the rational behaviour if trying to maximize privacy is to try and pick denominations that other users are likely to also pick.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we further suppose that all users suppose that all other users are guessing, and they take that into account in their guesses, we can avoid needing an infinite number of guesses if everybody assumes everyone's guesses will converge somehow. If this guessing leads to a Pareto efficient outcome then self interested users maximizing their privacy should not defect from the strategy of preferring to use the denominations that everyone is guessing everyone would prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, all of this must happen automatically as part of a distributed protocol where tens or even hundreds of users might all need to execute the protocol successfully so we need to automate this guesswork, and the automation must be efficient enough to not present a bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to go about this is to evaluate some kind of social preference function. One possiblity is to simulate a vote where each input casts votes in proportion to its satoshi value and the votes are cast on the denominations that would favor that input.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. decompose every input deterministically in a number of ways (e.g. greedy strategy with a number of subsets of standard denominations)\n",
    "2. for every solution votes for the denominations its composed out of, dividing the input amount by the weight of the solution\n",
    "3. tally the votes of all inputs to select some subset of \"winning\" denominations\n",
    "\n",
    "If everyone simulates the same vote and then decomposes their amounts using only the \"winning\" denominations the likelyhood that too many denominations will be used in smaller transactions is greatly reduced, depending on how many winners there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could conceivably be enforced by the coordinator (for example maybe only some amounts are allowed to be registered at first before other denominations or arbitrary values get \"unlocked\" in a round) or be completely advisory, where the coordinator just provides clients with the information. Input registrations are verifiable based on the ownership proofs, and output registrations can be verified after the fact before signing."

    "In order to compute the results, a specific protocol must be chosen. It seems some sort of cardinal voting system would be best suited, but more thought to the specific approach should be given. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is \"soft fork\"-ish territory, because different voting strategies may fragment the userbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different voting systems have [various properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_electoral_systems), some of which may be more appropriate for this particular use case. If large inputs get more votes a proportional system can ensure smaller inputs are also represented, but too much representation may lead to fragmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of possibilities we might want to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [cumulative voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_voting) - relatively simple\n",
    "- single transferrable vote\n",
    "- sequential proportional approval voting\n",
    "- reweighted range voting\n",
    "- Phragmen\n",
    "- [satisfaction approval voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfaction_approval_voting)\n",
    "- [distributed voting](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Distributed_Voting)\n",
    "- [borda count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count)\n",
    "- [justified representation](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/8417/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some cardinal/proportional voting systems are algorithmically infeasible, and every client would need to compute this at least once, possibly for every new input/output amount, so a reasonably efficient solution is called for especially if it appears that dynamic updates about registration lead to significantly better privacy or efficiency."

    "If the coordinator provides dynamic updates about output amounts that actually get registered then clients would be able to make infinitely better guesses about which denominations are likely to be used by other users. This implies either recomputing the election, or updating it.\n",
