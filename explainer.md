# WabiSabi by Analogy

[WabiSabi](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi) is a protocol (work in
progress) for constructing
[CoinJoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0)
transactions with the aid of a centralized coordinator. It utilizes
keyed-verification anonymous credentials, homomorphic value commitments,
and zero knowledge proofs to achieve privacy and flexibility.

This writeup attempts to give an intuition for how these different
cryptographic building blocks work by using a real world analogy
intended for readers who are already familiar with the concept of a
CoinJoin.

# Setting

Several Bitcoin users want to build a CoinJoin transaction with each
user contributing one or more UTXOs and arbitrarily reallocating their
contributed amount, without revealing to the coordinator or to each
other any links between their different inputs or the new outputs they
want to create.

To facilitate this a coordinator will keep a registry of the separate
inputs and outputs, ensuring that a user can only claim the amount of
Bitcoin they are entitled to, but without learning about the links
between these.

The coordinator will need an office to meet with the users, a
[seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_\(emblem\)) and some sealing
wax, an accurate scale with a large tray, and a blowtorch. The users
will need a number of envelopes, some sand, their own scales for private
use, and some convincing fake moustaches for incognito interactions
with the coordinator.

We will assume the weight of the envelopes themselves is negligible, or
can be easily corrected for, perhaps because they have a standard
weight.

If you want to have a better idea of how these components of our analogy
map to the actual crypto, skip to the final section, or continue reading
in order to build up an intuition first.

# Input Registration

For every UTXO a user wants to register as an input she will repeat the
following steps.

In the privacy of her own home she weighs out a quantity of sand, which we
assume is worthless, in proportion to the UTXO's value. She then distributes
the sand into a number of envelopes as she pleases, and closes them.

With her envelopes prepared, she puts on a fake moustache (a different one
for each input), so that the coordinator can't recognize her, and enters
the coordinator's office.

She convinces the coordinator that she can spend the UTXO in question,
and places the corresponding envelopes on the scale all at once, laid
flat on the tray.

The coordinator confirms that the total weight matches the UTXO value,
and if everything adds up, applies the seal to the closed envelopes
without handling them more than necessary (so that it can't guess the
weights), as the user observes.

The user can inspect the seal to make sure it matches some pictures,
published in advance, in order to be convinced that the coordinator
doesn't use slightly different ones to trace the individual wax seals
back to a specific input later.

The user collects the sealed envelopes from the tray and leaves.

# Output Registration

After all inputs have been registered, users can now use their envelopes
to register output amounts. The following steps are also repeated once per
output.

The user will put on yet another fake moustache, come into the coordinator's
office, and place an arbitrary combination of envelopes on the scale.

The coordinator checks that the seals are authentic, and then to ensure
that the envelopes can't be used again or weighed individually, they are
set on fire using the blowtorch, allowing the sand to spill out onto the
tray.

The coordinator adds the requested output with an amount corresponding
to weight of the sand on the tray, and the user leaves. The sand can be
discarded having served its purpose.

# Signing

When the input and output amounts are balanced the coordinator can conclude
that no non-empty envelopes remain, and builds the final CoinJoin transaction
with the registered inputs and outputs.

The users go back into the coordinator's office, once for each input
(wearing the appropriate moustache) and after confirming that the output
registrations have been included in the proposed transaction they sign
for that input.

After everyone has signed, the transaction can be broadcast.

# Cryptographic Counterparts

The cryptographic counterparts in the above analogy are as follows:

  - The envelopes are homomorphic value
    [commitments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_commitment),
    specifically Pedersen commitments. Commitments have two properties,
    *binding*, which means that once a value is committed it can't be
    changed, and *hiding*, which means that the value in the commitment
    is not revealed unless the committer opens the commitment. Note that
    in this protocol the commitments aren't actually opened, instead we
    only prove statements about the commitment openings in zero
    knowledge.
  - The scale and sand correspond to a [zero knowledge proof
    system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof),
    allowing the users to convince the coordinator of that the values in
    the commitments are correct without needing to reveal them (note
    that the sums appear on the blockchain).
  - The wax seals represent [keyed-verification anonymous
    credentials](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1416), which let the
    coordinator verify that it previously certified a specific value
    commitment as being a summand in the decomposition of an input
    amount without being able to link it to the input registration where
    the credential was issued.
  - The fake moustaches represent
    [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_\(anonymity_network\))
    circuits through which the users connect to the coordinator under
    pseudonymous network identities.
  - Setting the envelopes on fire is a bit of a looser analogy. First,
    it represents serial numbers for the credentials (derived from the randomness in the commitment), which are used to
    prevent double spending. Secondly, it gives an intuition for the
    homomorphic property of the commitments which simplifies
    proving that they add up to the correct input and
    output values without revealing the individual summands.
