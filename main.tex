Chaumian CoinJoin~\cite{mizrahi2013blind}\cite{maxwell2013coinjoin} is a technique used by Wasabi Wallet and Samourai Wallet~\cite{zerolink} to facilitate untrusted construction of collaborative Bitcoin transactions, also known as CoinJoins, by utilizing Chaumian blind signatures~\cite{chaum1983blind}. However this technique requires equal value denominations, which limits how such transactions can be constructed.

We propose to switch to a Keyed-Verification Anonymous Credentials-based (KVAC) scheme~\cite{chase2019signal} to enable more flexible transaction styles, like SharedCoin and CashFusion~\cite{cashfusion} style transactions and Knapsack~\cite{maurer2017anonymous} mixing. Our generalization also enables consolidation of UTXOs, minimizing unmixed change, relaxing minimum required denominations, payments in CoinJoins, better block space efficiency, and PayJoins in CoinJoins. We call this new protocol: WabiSabi.

\section{Protocol Overview}

\textit{Note that the following is an incomplete overview, in its current form it only attempts to give some intution for the cryptographic details described below. It is limited in scope to only the coomunication between user and server, and disregards the final CoinJoin transaction structure.}

\subsection{Roles}
In this protocol we define four different roles, three for the user, Alice, Bob and Satoshi, and the coordinator.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Alice is the role used for registering an input.
    \item Bob is the role used for registering an output.
    \item Satoshi is the role used for querying auxiliary data, such as the unsigned transaction.
    \item The coordinator facilitates the protocol. The protocol's main goal is to maintain privacy against the coordinator.
\end{itemize}

Each user role needs to be used with a different anonymity network identity, and users with multiple inputs or outputs must instantiate multiple Alices or Bobs, one for each input or output respectively.

\subsection{Terminology and notation}

\begin{definition} \textbf{Input}:
An existing Bitcoin transaction output that the user wants to use as an input in the CoinJoin transaction. For this section we represent inputs only in terms of their satoshi amount (integer) $v_{\mathit{in}}$, ignoring details like proving ownership. Details such as confirmation, standardness and other factors are outside the scope of this document.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} \textbf{Output}:
A Bitcoin transaction output that the user wishes to create in the CoinJoin without linking to any of their inputs or other outputs. Similarly to inputs, we represent outputs only in terms of their satoshi amount $v_{\mathit{out}}$, ignoring details like the \texttt{scriptPubKey}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} \textbf{Credential}:
An anonyous credential is issued by the coordinator at input registration, and certifies attributes that the coordinator validates before issuing. The user can then prove possession of a valid credential in zero-knowledge in order to register an output without the coordinator being able to link it to the input registration from which it originates, or any other output registrations.

We use the key-verifiable anonymous credential scheme from~\cite{chase2019signal}, instantiated with two group attributes (attributes whose value is an element of the underlying group $\mathbb{G}$).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\textbf{Attribute}:
In order to facilitate construction of Bitcoin transactions, a credential represents some amount of Bitcoin. For this we use two attributes: $M_v$ is a commitment to the amount of the registered input in satoshis and $M_s$ is a commitment to a serial number used for double spending prevention.

During credential presentation randomized versions of the attributes are presented, which we denote $C_v$ and $C_s$.
\end{definition}

Finally, $k$ is a protocol level constant, denoting the number of credentials used in input and output registration requests, and $v_{\mathit{max}} = 2^{51}-1$ constrains the amount value ranges\footnote{$\log_2(2099999997690000) \approx 50.9$}.

\subsection{High-level functionalities}
Hereby we give an informal and high-level description of applied cryptographic primitives. In the following the security parameter is denotes as $\lambda$. 
\subsubsection{Commitment schemes}
A commitment scheme allows a party to commit to a message without enabling them to change the committed message after publishing the commitment. On the other hand the commitment should not reveal anything about the committed message.

\noindent$\mathsf{Commit}(m,r)\xrightarrow{}\mathcal{C}$. The $\mathsf{Com}$ algorithm generates a commitment $\mathcal{C}$ to message $m$ using randomness $r$.

\noindent$\mathsf{OpenCom}(\mathcal{C},m,r)\xrightarrow{}\{\mathit{True},\mathit{False}\}$: one can verify the correctness of the opening of a commitment by checking $\mathcal{C}\stackrel{?}{=}\mathsf{Com}(m,r)$. If equality holds the algorithm outputs $\mathit{True}$, otherwise $\mathit{False}$.

For ease of understanding the reader can assume in the following that the commitment scheme is instantiated as a Pedersen commitment.

\subsubsection{MAC}
A message authentication code (MAC) ensures the integrity of a message and consists of the following three probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms.

\noindent$\mathsf{GenMACKey}(\lambda)\xrightarrow{}{\mathsf{sk}}$. a party generates a secret key $\mathsf{sk}$ for themselves for later MAC generations.

\noindent$\mathsf{MAC}_{\mathsf{sk}}(m)\xrightarrow{}t$. one can generate a MAC $t$ on a message a $m$ by using their $\mathsf{sk}$.

\noindent$\mathsf{VerifyMAC}_{\mathsf{sk}}(m,t)\xrightarrow{}\{\mathit{True},\mathit{False}\}$. The issuer of the MAC can verify a MAC $t$ given the message $m$ it was issued on.

The reader might intuitively think of a MAC as the symmetric-key counterpart of digital signatures. They both have the same goals and similar security requirements, however a MAC is not publicly verifiable.

\subsubsection{Zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge}
A very high-level, and hence somewhat imprecise, description of zero-knowledge proofs is provided. This protocol invovles a prover and a verifier. A prover whishes to prove that a relation $\mathcal{R}$ holds with respect to a secret input $w$, called witness, and public input $x$. Specifically, the prover wants to prove that $\mathcal{R}(x,w)=1$ without revealing anything about $w$.

\noindent$\mathsf{Prove}(x,w,\mathcal{R})\xrightarrow{}\pi$. Given $x$ and the private witness $w$ the prover generates a proof $\pi$.

\noindent$\mathsf{Verify}(x,\pi,\mathcal{R})\xrightarrow{}\{\mathit{True},\mathit{False}\}$. The verifier is given the proof $\pi$ and $x$ and decides whether the prover knows a secret $w$ such that $\mathcal{R}(x,w)=1$ holds.

\subsection{Input Registration} 

The user, acting as Alice, submits an input of value $v_{\mathit{in}}$ along with $k$ pairs of group attributes,
$(M_{v_i}, M_{s_i})$.
She proves in zero knowledge that the sum of the requested sub-amounts is equal to $v_{\mathit{in}}$ and that the individual amounts are positive integers in the allowed range.

% TODO decide if we want additional input credentials if we go with OR proof variant
% open questions:
% - single pedersen multicommitment for amount and serial or two separate group attributes?
% - if separate, extra generator + randomness for unconditional hiding of serial number even after revealing serial?

The coordinator verifies the proofs, and issues $k$ MACs on the requested attributes, along with a proof of knowledge of the secret key as described in \textit{Credential Issuance} protocol of \cite{chase2019signal}.

\subsection{Output Registration}

Now acting as Bob, to register her output the user randomizes the attributes and generates a proof of knowledge of a valid credential issued by the coordinator.

Additionally, she proves knowledge of representation of the serial number commitments. These serial numbers are revealed for double spending protection, but the knowledge of commitment opening must be done in zero knowledge to avoid revealing the randomness of the original commitment in the input registration phase or the randomization added in output registration time.

Finally, she proves that the sum of the randomized amount attributes $C_v$ matches the requested output amount $v_{\mathit{out}}$, analogously to input registration. Note that there is no need for range proofs at this phase.

The user submits these proofs, the randomized attributes, and the serial numbers. The coordinator verifies the proofs, and if it accepts the output will be included in the transaction.

\subsection{Signing phase}

The user fetches the finalized but unsigned transaction as Satoshi, and if she sees her registered outputs she will sign, submitting the signature as Alice(s).

\section{Cryptographic Details}

Following \cite{chase2019signal}, the scheme is defined in a group \(\mathbb{G}\) of prime order \(q,\) written in multiplicative notation. 
$\mathsf{HashTo\mathbb{G}} : {0,1}^* \mapsto \mathbb{G}$ is a function from strings to group elements, based on a cryptographic hash function.

We require the following fixed set of group elements for use as generators with different purposes:
\[
\underbrace{G_{w}, G_{w^{\prime}}, G_{x_{0}}, G_{x_{1}}, G_{V}}_{\mathsf{MAC} \text{~and~} \mathsf{Show}}
\qquad
\underbrace{G_{v}, G_{s}}_{\text{attributes}}
\qquad
\underbrace{G_g, G_h}_{\text{commitments}}
\]
chosen so that nobody knows the discrete logarithms between any pair of them, e.g. $G_h = \mathsf{HashTo\mathbb{G}}(``\texttt{h}")$.

This notation deviates slightly from \cite{chase2019signal}, in that we subscript the attribute generators $G_{y_i}$ as $G_v$ and $G_s$ instead of using numerical indices, and we require two additional generators $G_g$ and $G_h$ for constructing the attributes $M_v$ and $M_s$ as Pedersen commitments.

As with the generator names, we modify the names of the attribute related components of the secret key
$\mathrm{sk} := (w, w^{\prime}, x_{0}, x_{1}, y_{v}, y_{s}) \in_R {\mathbb{Z}_q}^6$
according to our fixed set of group attributes.

The coordinator parameters
$\mathit{iparams} =  (C_{W}, I)$
are computed as:
\[
C_{W}={G_w}^{w} {G_{w^\prime}}^{w^\prime}
\quad
I=\frac{G_{V}}{{G_{x_0}}^{x_0} {G_{x_1}}^{x_1} {G_{y_v}}^{y_v} {G_{y_s}}^{y_s}}
\]
These are used by the coordinator to prove correctness of issued MACs, and by the users to prove knowledge of a valid MAC.

\subsection{Input Registration}

Acting as Alice, the user wants to register an input with value $v_{\mathit{in}}$, arbitrarily dividing it into amounts $v_i$ where $i \in \left[1,k\right]$. For each $i \in [1, k]$ she chooses a serial number and randomness $s_i \in_R \mathbb{Z}_q$ and commits to these with randomness $r_{v_i}, r_{s_i} \in_R \mathbb{Z}_q$:
\[ M_{v_i}={G_g}^{r_{v_i}}{G_h}^{v_i} \qquad M_{s_i}={G_g}^{r_{s_i}}{G_h}^{s_i} \]

These commitments will be used as attributes in the credential request. For each amounts she also computes a range proof which ensures there are no negative values:
\[
\pi^{\mathit{range}}_i := \operatorname{PK}\left\{\left(v_i, r_{v_i} \right) :
M_{v_i} = {G_g}^{r_{v_i}}{G_h}^{v_i}
\land
0 \leq v_i < v_{\mathit{max}} \right\}
\]

Alice also needs to convince the coordinator that the amounts add up to $v_{\mathit{in}}$, which she can prove by including the following witness-hiding proof:
\[ \pi^{\mathit{sum}}=\sum_{i=1}^{k} r_{v_i} \]

Finally, to request the credentials she submits the input, the $k$ pairs of attributes, and the proofs. The coordinator calculates the product of the amount commitments and checks:

\[ \prod_{i=1}^{k} M_{v_i}
\stackrel{?}{=}
{G_g}^{\pi^{\mathit{sum}}}{G_h}^{v_{\mathit{in}}}
\]

Note that this equality over the product of the commitments implies the following  equality of the sum of the amounts is correct:
\[\prod_{i=1}^{k} M_{v_i}
= {G_g}^{\sum_{i=1}^{k} r_{v_i}} {G_h}^{\sum_{i=1}^{k} v_i} 
\iff
\sum_{i=1}^{k} v_i = v_{\mathit{in}}
\]

If the coordinator accepts then for each $i \in [1,k]$ it issues a credential by responding with
$(t_i, U_i, V_i) \in \mathbb{Z}_q \times \mathbb{G} \times \mathbb{G}$,
which is the output of
$\mathsf{MAC}_{\mathsf{sk}}(M_{v_i}, M_{s_i})$,
where:
\[
t_i \in_{R} \mathbb{Z}_{q}, U_i \in_{R} \mathbb{G}
\qquad
V_i=W {U_i}^{x_{0}+x_{1} t_i}{M_{v_i}}^{y_v} {M_{s_i}}^{y_s}
\]

To rule out tagging individual users the coordinator must prove knowledge of the secret key, and that $(t_i, U_i, V_i)$ is correct relative to $\mathit{iparams}=(C_{W}, I)$:

\begin{align*}
\pi_{i}^{\mathit{iparams}}=\operatorname{PK}\{ & (w, w^{\prime}, x_{0}, x_{1}, y_v, y_s): \\
&C_{W}={G_{w}}^{w} {G_{w^{\prime}}}^{w^\prime} \land \\
&I=\frac{G_{V}}{{G_{x_{0}}}^{x_0} {G_{x_1}}^{x_1} {G_{y_v}}^{y_v} {G_{y_s}}^{y_s}} \land \\
&V_i={G_w}^{w}{U_i}^{x_{0}+x_{1}t_i} M_{v_i} M_{s_i}
\}
\end{align*}


\subsection{Output Registration}

After the input registration the user may have up to $n$ credentials from all of her input registration requests made as one or more Alice identities.
Let $S \subseteq \left[1,n\right]$ be the indices of credentials that she wants to consolidate into a single output registration.

\subsubsection{Credential validity}

For each credential $i \in S$, now acting as Bob, the user executes the $\mathsf{Show}$ protocol as described in~\cite{chase2019signal}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item She chooses
$z_i \in_{R} \mathbb{Z}_{q}$,
and computes 
$z_{0_i}=-{t_i} {z_i} (\bmod q)$
and the randomized commitments:

\begin{align*}
C_{v_i}     &= {G_v}^{z_i} M_{v_i} \\
C_{s_i}     &= {G_s}^{z_i} M_{s_i} \\
C_{x_{0_i}} &= {G_{x_0}}^{z_i} {U_i} \\
C_{x_{1_i}} &= {G_{x_1}}^{z_i} {U_i}^{t_i} \\
C_{V_i}     &= {G_V}^{z_i} V_i
\end{align*}

\item To prove to the coordinator that she is in possession of a valid credential, Bob computes a proof of knowledge of the MAC on her attributes:
\begin{align*}
\pi_{i}^{\mathsf{MAC}}=\operatorname{PK}\{
& (z_i, z_{0_i},t_i): \\
& Z_i =I^{z_i} \land \\ %% does this proof need to say anything about C_{m_i} or C_{s_i} or is this statement about Z enough?
& C_{x_{1_i}} = {C_{x_{0_i}}}^{t_i} {G_{x_0}}^{z_{0_i}} {G_{x_1}}^{z_i}\}
\end{align*}
%% if we go with OR proof, then \lor M_{v_i} = {G_g}^{r_{v_i}} {G_h}^0
which implies the following without allowing the verifier to link $\pi_{i}^\mathit{MAC}$ to the underlying attributes $(M_{v_i}, M_{s_i})$:
\[
\mathsf{Verify}((C_{x_{0_i}}, C_{x_{1_i}}, C_{V_i}, C_{v_i}, C_{s_i}, Z_i), \pi_i^{\mathit{MAC}}) \iff \mathsf{VerifyMAC}_{\mathsf{sk}}(M_{v_i}, M_{s_i})
\]


\item Bob submits $(C_{x_{0_i}}, C_{x_{1_i}}, C_{V_i}, C_{v_i}, C_{s_i}, \pi_i^{\mathit{MAC}})$ and the coordinator computes:
\[
Z_i=\frac{C_{V_i}}{{G_w}^w {C_{x_{0_i}}}^{x_0} {C_{x_{1_i}}}^{x_{1}}
{C_{v_i}}^{y_v} {C_{s_i}}^{y_s}
}
\]
independently of Bob's derivation by using the secret key , and verifies $\pi_i^{\mathit{MAC}}$.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Over-spending prevention by proving sum of amounts}

The product of the randomized amount commitments is:

\[\prod_{i \in S} C_{{v_i}}
= \prod_{i \in S} {G_v}^{z_i}M_{v_i}
= {G_v}^{\sum_{i \in S} z_i}{G_g}^{\sum_{i \in S} r_{v_i}}{G_h}^{\sum_{i \in S} v_i}
\]

Therefore we can obtain a witness-hiding proof for the sum of the committed values $v_i$ in the randomized commitments:

\[ \pi^{v_{out}}=\left(\sum_{i \in S}z_i,\sum_{i \in S}r_{v_i}\right) \]

The coordinator checks whether
\[
\prod_{i \in S} C_{v_i}
\stackrel{?}{=}
{G_v}^{\pi^{v_{out}}[1]} {G_g}^{\pi^{v_{out}}[2]} {G_h}^{v_{\mathit{out}}}
\]

The coordinator can compute the right hand side of the verification equation, since she obtained the exponents of each of the generator points from the submitted $\pi^{v_{out}}$. Informally soundness of the proof system holds as user does not know the discrete logs between the generator points used in the randomized commitments. While zero-knowledge is ensured since $\sum_{i \in S}z_i$ does not leak anything about individual $z_i$. We can have a similar argument for $\sum_{i \in S}r_{v_i}$ and $r_{v_i}$.

\subsubsection{Double-spending prevention by revealing serial numbers}

Bob proves knowledge of representation of her submitted randomized serial number commitments, namely:
\[
\pi_{i}^{\mathit{serial}}=\operatorname{PK}\{ (s_i, z_i, r_{s_i}):C_{s_i} = {G_s}^{z_i}{G_g}^{r_{s_i}}{G_h}^{s_i}
\}
\]
where the serial number $s_i$ is a public input, revealed to prevent double spending. The coordinator checks that the $s_i$ have not been used before (but allowing for idempotent output registration).

Note that after revealing $s_i$, we no longer have perfect hiding in the $M_{s_i}$ commitment, since, because there is exactly one $r_{s_i} \in \mathbb{Z}_q$ such that $M_{s_i} = {G_g}^{r_{s_i}} {G_h}^{s_i}$. To preserve user privacy in case of a crypto break we can add another randomness term with an additional generator to the the serial number commitment.
