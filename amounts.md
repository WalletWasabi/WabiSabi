# Amount Organization Specification for Wasabi Wallet 2.0

## Target User

Peter McCormack

## Objectives

- Avoid homogenic coin distribution.
- Avoid UTXO bloat.
- Significantly lower minimum denominations compared to [WW1.](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/)
- Thrive for not generating non-mixed changes.
- Thrive for faster mixing.
- Thrive for more blockspace efficient mixing.

## Approach

Since this amount organization will be used in Wasabi Wallet 2.0, a sensible strategy is to start out with the current amount organization of WW1 and step by step improve upon that.
