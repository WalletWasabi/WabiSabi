# Amount Organization Specification for Wasabi Wallet 2.0

## Target User

Peter McCormack

## Objectives

- Avoid homogenic coin distribution.
- Avoid UTXO bloat.
- Significantly lower minimum denominations compared to [WW1.](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/)
- Thrive for not generating non-mixed changes.
- Thrive for faster mixing.
- Thrive for more blockspace efficient mixing.

## Approach

Since this amount organization will be used in Wasabi Wallet 2.0, a sensible strategy is to start out with the current amount organization of WW1 and step by step improve upon that.

### Setup

In order to verify our reasoning and intuitions we [sampled 8000 input amounts](./AmountOrganization/AmountOrganization/Sample.txt) from Wasabi Wallet 1.0 coinjoins around December 2020, those have not been mixed before.  
We'll use them in various ways throughout this document, mostly from code, which source can be found under [AmountOrganization solution.](./AmountOrganization)

#### BASE: WWI Skeleton

To start out, from our sample we took a set of 50 inputs randomly and created 40 random groupings - users - out of it. Then we implemented WW1's mixing technique and got the following example output.

How does WW1's mixing technique work? It takes the amounts and loops them through powers of 2 denominations in ascending order. It creates outputs for every denomination level the user can still participate in. If it can't it creates a change output.

We shall also note that this example dismisses many variables, most importantly the minimum denomination Wasabi imposes and the network fees. We'll introduce them later on.

#### Dust Strategy

Our next thought was to make a drastic change on the amount organization structure, but we realized the nature of the change may depend on how fees are handled and that may depend on our dust handling strategy, thus it's reasonable to continue with that.  
So far we've created a transaction that isn't standard, because many outputs, like one satoshi outputs are present. To manage this issue and make our transaction standard, we want to make sure users don't register small outputs by setting a dust limit.  
Dismissing the dust by the user is fine, because it's not significant amount. Let's assume our dust limit is 1000 satoshis, which should satisfy the standardness rules.

Although we handled our standardness problem, we also want to make sure we don't create uneconomical outputs. Our working formula for this is: `MAX((feerate * input spend size estimation), 1000, (minimum relay fee rate * input spend size estimation))`.
If we choose the current fee rate to 10s/vb, and estimate our input spend size to 69 bytes, then we'll still be under the 1000 satoshi sanity fee rate, so we don't need to illustrate our new results.

#### Fee Strategy

In order to account for real world mining fees we subtracted the estimated amounts paid for every input and every output.

#### Descending Powers of 2

It would be more efficient to do descending powers of 2 mixing instead of ascending powers of 2 mixing like we did before. So we implemented this and here's what we noticed:

- Now more dust coins would be created, but because of their low economic value, these coins are not created and instead their value is added to the miner fees. Note that dust warnings are omitted on the output pasted here.
- We're creating roughly half the number of outputs, which is great for blockspace.  
- We've nearly completely eliminated change.  

Furthermore a few more small optimization was introduced:

- Our sanity dust threshold became 1024, so we won't create smaller change than that.  
- A user now also considers the largest output that isn't hers so she won't create denomination that would be larger than the largest possible user's output she could reasonably mix with.
- Finally we considered breaking down the largest user's change output, to the largest possible denomination, but we couldn't decide, so that'll be a later step.

Our simulation also got an improvement as now we're also simulating a 30% remix count by doing a pre-mix, then select 30% of those inputs to create our random groups and have results from that.

#### Average Anonymity Set and Blockspace Efficiency

Next we introduced an average anonymity set calculation and calculated blockspace efficiency from that. Note that this only works for equal output coinjoins (where we are right now) but it will fail for Knapsack like ambiguity techniques when we'll introduce them.

#### Should we break down the largest user's bag?
A user whose combined input amount is significantly larger (or smaller) than the other users' amounts always faces difficulties in mixing.
In this subsection we address different approaches to managing large output amounts. Smaller amounts are not addressed here.
We identified five possible approaches. 

The trivial approach is not to break the large input(s) up. 
We just produce a large amount change minus the fees. This output is deterministically linkable to its input cluster.
Potentially, it might also reveal what other amounts were used by the user.

Next, we consider different ways of splitting up the large amounts. 
If these amounts are split up too granularly, then a single user with more liquidity than others is indistinguishable from a sybil attack.
Additionally, this user gains little privacy themselves (probabilistic privacy instead of k-anonymity). 
Moreover, this approach is not blockspace efficient.
On the other hand, if they are split up too coarsely, then that user's amounts are deterministically linkable to their inputs.

We discuss the following approaches for splitting up the large amount inputs:
The following design decisions need to be made.
  
Amount selection (How does the wallet select the amounts subtracted from the large input?) 
 - Standard denominations   
 - Knapsack
 
Limits of the process:
 - One-shot
 - iterative
   - deterministic
   - probabilistic
   
  
Coinflip: we could combine the two approaches probabilistically by flipping a random coin. 

Since more sophisticated denomination systems rely on participating in the same denomination level, we'll go with a breakdwon approach and limit it later.
