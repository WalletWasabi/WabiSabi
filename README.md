WabiSabi is an anonymous credential scheme for centrally coordinated CoinJoin
transactions.

[Click here for the latest version of the
paper.](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/releases/latest/download/WabiSabi.pdf)

A [simplified explainer](./explainer.md) with an informal description by
analogy using real world concepts is also provoided.

For more information on how the credential scheme can be applied, we also
describe a [generic protocol](./protocol.md) (work in progress).

Details of the specific transaction structure are still TBD.
